          <p>
            I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at Texas A&M University with minors in Statistics 
            and Business. Outside of academics, I like to watch Netflix, bake chocolate chip cookies,
            make terrible jokes, read books of all kind, while simultaneously running side quests.
