            Hullo! My name is Kavya Agar.

            I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at Texas A&M University with minors in Statistics 
            and Business. I'm passionate about machine learning, data science, and software engineering, where 
            I love exploring how I can solve problems.

            When I'm not coding, you can find me baking chocolate chip cookies, diving into a good book, 
            or trying to make people laugh with my terrible jokes. I believe that a well-rounded life 
            fuels my side quests.

            Join my journey as I explore the world of technology and share my experiences along the way!
