        Hullo! I'm Kavya, an undergraduate Computer Science student at Texas A&M University with minors in Statistics 
        and Business. I'm passionate about machine learning, data science, and software engineering, where 
        I love exploring how I can solve problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Problems can present themselves in all sorts of ways, and I enjoy the learning that comes with tackling each 
        one. As of now, I'm focused on letting my curiosity fly free, taking me from fintech and space technology 
        to gaming and AI. I'm driven by the challenge of transforming abstract ideas into impactful, usable 
        solutions—whether that means training an NLP model, engineering efficient backend systems, or building 
        intuitive frontends that make UIs more interactive.

      <p>
        When I'm not fixing errors, you can find me baking chocolate chip cookies, diving into a good book, 
        or making people laugh with my terrible jokes. I strongly believe that a well-rounded life 
        fuels my side quests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Join my journey as I explore the world of technology and share my experiences along the way—hopefully 
        with fewer bugs than in my code.
